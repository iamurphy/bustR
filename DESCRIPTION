Description: This package is used to manually label the phases of dives in a time-depth
    dataset. The labelling of dives is done using Shiny, an R package which creates 
    interactive web applications. This package also provides tools which allow the users 
    to manually label only a subset of the total number of dives in their dataset, then 
    build models using this training data which can be applied to the remainder of their dataset.
